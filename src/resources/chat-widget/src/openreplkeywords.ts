export const documentation = `\nOpenREPL is an Online platform for checking codes in REPLs for various languages like C/C++, golang, python etc. It can be very useful for exploratory programming and debugging, specially for those who are beginners in learning any of the new programming languages. It can also be very useful for the developers who want to check small code snippets quickly in REPL before embedding the code in there applications. Learn how to play around REPL.\n\nFollow below links for specific languages to know more:\n\nCling for C/C++\nThe C++ interactive interpreter Cling is based on LLVM and its C++ frontend clang.
